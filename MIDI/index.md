# MIDI Notes and Examples

Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) is a protocol developed as a standard for digital musical instruments and controllers.  

With microcontrollers and TouchDesigner you can make your own custom physical and  or digital MIDI instruments and controllers.  The following examples will go through some ways to use TouchDesigner's and Arduino's MIDI capabilities to start making sound.
