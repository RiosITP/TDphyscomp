## Welcome 
This is an evolving resource for connecting [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) to the [TouchDesigner](https://derivative.ca/) platform in various ways.  Most of these examples have been tested using an Arduino Nano 33 IoT however many of the examples will work with other Arduino Boards as well as other microcontrollers.  This is a living resources and will be updated periodically with more tutorials.

The following tutorials and resources show a few different ways to communicate between your microcontroller and the TouchDesigner platform. Topics covered will include:
- Serial communication
    - One way Communication
    - Two way Communication
    - Using Serial data interactively in TouchDesigner
    - Controlling microcontroller outputs with TouchDesigner
- MIDI Communication
- Wifi Communication
- OSC Communicaiton
